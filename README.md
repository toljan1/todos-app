My to-do app project was to create a responsive and user-friendly interface using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. In this application you can add, delete, sort and mark as completed your task. I designed the user interface with simplicity and elegance. I've also done extensive testing to make sure the interface works flawlessly in all browsers.

Technologies used:

HTML5
SCSS
JS ES6
